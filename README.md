### Premise

The premise of this challenge is to create a "profile page" for various star wars characters in the Star Wars universe.

### Specification

Create a simple single page application that provides the following features:

  * A search bar that takes the characters name as input.
  * A profile containing the following sectional information for the searched character:
    * About Me (height, weight, hair color, date of birth, species information)
    * Films Appeared In
    * Starships Flown

Use [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/) to obtain all the star wars data that you need. Note that the api does not allow you to search by name. :smiling_imp:

Use whatever languages or tech you want -- we are looking for clean, testable code that demonstrates usage of common design patterns and best practices above all else. 

### BUT

You will get bonus points if...

* Basic react.js understanding is demonstrated...
* A basic "gateway" api is created to consolidate and proxy calls to SWAPI...
* You add cool and creative features not included in the spec...
